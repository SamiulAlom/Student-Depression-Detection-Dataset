# Student-Depression-Detection-Dataset

We collected data from two distinct datasets representing urban and rural areas in Bangladesh. To achieve this, the datasets were care- fully curated to reflect the sociocultural and demographic diversity present among Bangladeshi university students. The first dataset is respondents from students living in urban in Bangladesh, which is generally a wealthier area. The data were predominantly obtained by online surveys which were developed using Microsoft Forms following the suggestions of experts from the field of medicine and ensured the validity of the parameters. Facebook and LinkedIn social media platforms were used to distribute the survey extensively to reach university student groups and networks. Settings were encoded such as gender, age, family background, rela- tionship status, marital status, living style, current semester, good friend circle, health condition, monthly cost(without study), home division, and current CGPA. The total of 3350 responses were collected, of which 826 students were depressed and 2524 were not. This shows a high prevalence of depression among urban students. Rural students from Bangladesh, who are also generally from poor regions, were included in the second dataset. This dataset was collected face-to-face in several rural universities. By using this method, we could ensure all students were represented including those who may not have digital access. The rural dataset captured the same eleven parameters and yielded 3,097 responses, sim- ilar to the urban dataset. Of these 3097, 690 cases were considered as depressed and 2,407 were non-depressed individuals. Interestingly we see, that urban stu- dents are more depressed than rural students. In analyzing these two datasets, we hope to capture the varied overall student experiences and challenges in both urban and rural environments. The use of both sources makes the analysis relevant and applicable to various socio- economic backgrounds across Bangladesh, increasing the generalizability of the analysis.
